# Employees-Presence-Analysis(Power BI Dashboard)

This Power BI dashboard analyzes employee attendance data for the year 2022, offering critical insights into presence trends, work-from-home (WFH) patterns, and sick leave (SL) behavior across the organization. 

It was developed to assist HR teams and decision-makers in understanding weekly attendance behavior, optimizing space planning, and identifying absenteeism trends to improve workplace efficiency and employee well-being.


##  1. Problem

Modern organizations, especially those transitioning to hybrid work models, face several challenges:

- Lack of visibility into employee attendance trends, especially **Work From Home (WFH)** and **Sick Leave (SL)** patterns.
- Difficulty identifying which days of the week have **low office presence**, affecting collaboration, space utilization, and productivity.
- **Inefficient infrastructure usage** due to poor space planning in the absence of attendance data.
- Inability to proactively respond to patterns like **spikes in SL**, which may indicate health risks (e.g., COVID outbreaks).

> These insights are crucial to optimize workspace costs, ensure employee well-being, and make data-driven HR decisions.
